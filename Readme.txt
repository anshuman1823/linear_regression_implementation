This repository is an implementation of gradient descent from scratch. Gradient descent solution is compared with least squares solution. Ridge regression is also implemented and the solution obtained compared with the gradient descent solution and least squares solution.


Instructions to run the code:

1. All the source code for all the algortihms and functions are kept in separate .py files. All these .py files should be maintained in the same directory.

2. The "main.py" file is the main file containing code to carry out all the tasks given in the 
assignment. Therefore, you only need to run this "main.py" file. It will automatically import all the other necessary functions.

3. Keep the training and test datasets inside a folder named "datasets". This folder should
be in the same directory as that of all the other .py files.
